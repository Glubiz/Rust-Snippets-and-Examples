# Cryptography in Rust

This folder contains code snippets and explanations for implementing various cryptographic algorithms in Rust. Cryptography is the practice of securing communications in the presence of adversaries. In this folder, you will find examples of the following cryptographic algorithms: Caesar Cipher, HMAC, RSA, and Vigenere Cipher.

## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This shift value, also known as the key, is used for both encryption and decryption.

## HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)

HMAC is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key. It is used to verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message.

## RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. It uses two keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The security of RSA relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large composite integers.

## Vigenere Cipher

The Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. It uses a keyword to shift the letters in the plaintext, with the keyword being repeated as many times as necessary to match the length of the plaintext.

## Cryptography in Rust

Rust provides various libraries for implementing cryptographic algorithms, such as `rust-crypto` and `ring`. These libraries provide a wide range of cryptographic primitives, including encryption, decryption, and hashing.

To implement a cryptographic algorithm in Rust:

1. Understand the algorithm and its required components (e.g., keys, ciphers, hash functions).
2. Choose an appropriate library or implement the algorithm from scratch, if necessary.
3. Write functions for encryption and decryption, ensuring proper error handling and adherence to the algorithm's specifications.
4. Test your implementation with sample data and validate the results.
