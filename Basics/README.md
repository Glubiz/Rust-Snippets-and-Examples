# Rust Basics

This folder contains code snippets and explanations for fundamental concepts in the Rust programming language, including collections, concurrency, control flow, database integrations, enums and pattern matching, functions, modules, ownership, sets, strings, structs, traits and generics, and types.

## Collections

Collections are data structures that store multiple values. Rust provides several built-in collection types, such as `Vec` (dynamic arrays), `HashMap` (key-value stores), and `HashSet` (unique value sets). Each collection type has its own set of methods and performance characteristics.

## Concurrency

Concurrency in Rust is achieved through threads and message passing. Rust provides the `std::thread` module to create and manage threads, and `std::sync` module to facilitate safe communication between threads.

## Control Flow

Control flow structures in Rust include `if`, `else`, `while`, `loop`, and `for` expressions, which allow developers to control the flow of execution in their programs based on conditions or iterations.

## Database Integrations

Rust supports database integrations through external libraries, such as `diesel` for working with SQL databases and `mongodb` for working with MongoDB.

## Enums and Pattern Matching

Enums are custom data types that consist of a set of named values, called variants. Pattern matching is used to destructure and inspect enums using the `match` expression or `if let` and `while let` expressions.

## Functions

Functions are named sequences of code that take a set of input values (parameters) and return a value. Functions in Rust can be defined with the `fn` keyword and can be associated with structs or enums as methods.

## Modules

Modules are a way to organize and encapsulate code in Rust. They can be used to group related functions, structs, and other items together, and to control the visibility of items using the `pub` keyword.

## Ownership

Ownership is a central concept in Rust that ensures memory safety without a garbage collector. Every value in Rust has a single owner, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically deallocated.

## Sets

Sets are collections of unique values. In Rust, sets are implemented using the `HashSet` and `BTreeSet` types from the `std::collections` module.

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters. Rust has two main string types: `String` (a growable, mutable, UTF-8 encoded string) and `&str` (an immutable, fixed-length string slice).

## Structs

Structs are custom data types that allow you to group together related values. Rust has three types of structs: named-field structs, tuple structs, and unit structs.

## Traits and Generics

Traits are a way to define shared behavior across multiple types, while generics allow for writing code that works with multiple types without duplication. Traits and generics can be combined to create powerful abstractions and reusable code.

## Types

Rust has several built-in types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters. Additionally, you can define custom types using structs, enums, and type aliases.
