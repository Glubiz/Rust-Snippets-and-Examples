# Algorithms and Data Structures

This folder contains code snippets and explanations for some common algorithms and data structures, focusing on binary search, merge sort, and quick sort. Understanding these fundamental concepts is essential for any programmer, as they form the basis for efficient problem-solving and optimized code.

## Binary Search

Binary search is a searching algorithm that efficiently finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, comparing the middle element of the interval with the target value. If the middle element matches the target value, its position is returned. If the target value is less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the interval, respectively.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by recursively splitting an array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together. The key step is the merging process, which combines two sorted arrays into a single, sorted output array.

Time Complexity:
- Best case: O(n log n)
- Average case: O(n log n)
- Worst case: O(n log n)

## Quick Sort

Quick sort is another divide and conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two groups, those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. The pivot is then placed in its correct position, and the process is recursively applied to the two groups until the array is sorted.

Time Complexity:
- Best case: O(n log n)
- Average case: O(n log n)
- Worst case: O(n^2)
